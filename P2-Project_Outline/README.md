## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The family tree of processed foods site will create a greater sense of connectivity in a disconnected world. In developed countries, it's unusual to have a grasp of where your food comes from, especially when it's processed and plastic wrapped into forms that seem far removed from the natural world. The family tree of processed foods is a database of processed foods, the ingredients they're made of, and the natural resources those ingredients are derived from.  
### Features
- Search: you can search by processed foods, ingredients, and natural resources to see what else they're connected to. 
- Dynamic website, open to user content: you can create a record of a new processed food and add its ingredients or choose ingredients from an existing list. You can also add natural resources or connect new ingredients to existing natural resources. 
- Drill down: see more information about how an ingredient is processed or created or what geographic region a natural resource came from
- Bonus feature for if I have time and knowledge: engaging visual web with hover effects to highlight certain bits of information and to show how different objects are related
### Technologies
Java, Springboot, Hibernate, Thymeleaf templates, JavaScript, CSS
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to stretch my knowledge of how databases can be configured using Thymeleaf, Hibernate, etc. A big part of my dream for this site is to have stunning, engaging visuals, so I'll be learning more CSS as well as JavaScript to see what's possible there.
